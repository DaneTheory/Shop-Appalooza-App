## Original Task This App Solves:

Develop a single page application that contains a product list and a product details page. The products can be requested from the following url:http://awsstaging.flashtalkingfeeds.com/temp/bas/test-api/get.php 

The only requirement of the application will be that you use angular or React. You can use any desired scaffolding tool or libraries. 
Bear in mind, once you have accomplished this we may ask you to create the possibility to add products using your application, so make it as extensible as possible.
Once you have done this, save the application in a zip file and mail it over to us (or via a git repository). If your application includes a readme file place it root directory.
